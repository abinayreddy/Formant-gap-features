# Formant-gap-features
To extract formant gap features for whisper speaker verification

This code is for computing formant-Gap features for whisper speaker
verification task, which is proposed in the below paper.

A. R. Naini, A. R. M. V, and P. K. Ghosh, “Formant-gaps features for speaker verification using whispered speech,” 
in IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2019.

Compile using Main.m
This will create a folder features, and extract audio files from then audio folder and place the computed features in the created futures folder.
